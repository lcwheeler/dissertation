To render a PDF version clone the this repo, navigate to the dissertation directory, and 
run the following command:

```pdflatex main.tex``` 

This will create a PDF called "main.pdf", which is a full copy of my dissertation.  

Alternatively, you can use the pdflatex function in a LaTex editor such as [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/).
